## Steps

Step 1: Wireframing and Layout Design
The first step involved wireframing the overall layout and defining sections like "About Me," "Projects," "Experience," and "Contact." This phase ensured a logical flow of information and an intuitive user experience.

 
Step 2: Coding the Framework
Using HTML and CSS, the basic structure of the portfolio was built. The layout was made responsive to ensure it looked good on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.


Step 3: Adding an Experience and Project Section
The "Projects" section was developed to display key projects, with descriptions and links to GitHub repositories. Each project card included a hover effect and a button linking to the project's GitHub page.


Step 4: Testing and Deployment
The portfolio was tested for responsiveness, usability, and security. It was deployed on GitHub Pages for public access.
